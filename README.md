## Environment Variables ‚öôÔ∏è

This Next.js application requires an environment variable to know the location of the backend API.

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add the following variable:

```env
# The base URL of the backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

This variable tells the application where to send API requests (e.g., to fetch, create, or delete tasks).

## Connecting to the Backend üîó

This frontend application is designed to work with its corresponding backend API. **Before running the frontend, please ensure the backend server is installed, configured, and already running.**

You can find the setup instructions in the backend repository's README file.
